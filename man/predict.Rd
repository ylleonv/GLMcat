\title{Predict method for a a fitted \code{glmcat} model object}
\usage{
\method{predict}{glmcat}(object, newdata, type, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class \code{glmcat}.}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for the variables involved in the model. If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.}

\item{type}{the type of prediction required.
The default is \code{"prob"} which gives the probabilities, the other option is
\code{"linear.predictor"} which gives predictions on the scale of the linear predictor.}

\item{...}{further arguments.
The default is \code{"prob"} which gives the probabilities, the other option is
\code{"linear.predictor"} which gives predictions on the scale of the linear predictor.}
