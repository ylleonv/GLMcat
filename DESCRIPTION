Description: Generalized Linear Models for categorical responses: In statistical modeling, there is a wide variety of regression models for categorical dependent variables (nominal or ordinal data); yet, there is no software embracing all these models together in a uniform and generalized format. We propose an R package to estimate generalized linear models implemented under the unified specification (r, F, Z) , where r represents the ratio of probabilities (reference, cumulative, adjacent, or sequential), F the cumulative distribution function for the linkage, and Z, the design matrix.
