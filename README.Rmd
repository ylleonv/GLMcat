# GLMcat

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ylleonv/GLMcat")
```

We introduce and illustrate GLMcat, the R package we developed to estimate generalized linear models implemented under the unified specification $(r, F, Z)$, where $r$ represents the ratio of probabilities (reference, cumulative, adjacent or sequential), $F$ the cumulative cdf function for the linkage, and $Z$ the design matrix. We present the properties of the four families of models, which must be investigated when selecting the components $r$, $F$, and $Z$. The functions are user-friendly and fairly intuitive; offering the possibility to choose from a large range of models through a combination $(r, F, Z)$.
